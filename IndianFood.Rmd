```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Importing data into R

Variable_name <- read.csv("location of the file")

### Example
```{r}

IndianFood<- read.csv("C:/Projects/IndianFood2/indian_food.csv")


Indian_Food <- IndianFood %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    summarise(averageCookTime = mean(cook_time),
             sdCooking = sd(cook_time))

```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
